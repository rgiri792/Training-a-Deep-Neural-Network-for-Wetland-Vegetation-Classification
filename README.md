Hyperspectral Deep Neural Network for Wetland Vegetation Classification ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒŠ  This project implements a Deep Neural Network (DNN) using PyTorch to classify wetland vegetation types from hyperspectral data. The dataset consists of 13 classes of wetland cover types, with reflectance values measured across 176 spectral bands.
